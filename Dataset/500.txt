After these two steps, the actions required to complete the instruction depend on the instruction class. Fortunately, for each of the three instruction classes (memory-reference, arithmetic-logical, and branches), the actions are largely the same, independent of the exact instruction. The simplicity and regularity of the RISC-V instruction set simplify the implementation by making the execution of many of the instruction classes similar. For example, all instructions classes do the arithmetic.
